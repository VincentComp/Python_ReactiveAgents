Comp3211 Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence

In this project, we trained a boundary following agent with different algorithms from scratch(totally a greenfield project):

* Task1: Given the training dataset containing the mapping relationship between the 8 barrier sensor and action of the boundary following agent, I applied the genetic alogrithms to achieve the best-fit program in the boundary following agent.

* Task2: Given the training dataset containing the mapping relationship between the 8 barrier sensor and action of the boundary following agent, I applied the error correction procedure to train a perceptron model, which allows the boundary following agent to perform suitable action corresponding sensory input.

* Task3: In this task, the boundary following is implemented as a state machine with a designed production system.
